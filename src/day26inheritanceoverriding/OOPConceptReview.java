/*
 * OOP Concept has 
 * 1) Encapsulation
 * 		a) Data hiding
 * 		b) By using "private" access modifier, we can hide data
 * 		c) After hiding if you want to read data from other classes, create getters,
 * 		d) After hiding if you want to update data from other classes, create setters,
 * 		e) To create objects from classes in java, we have many ways,
 * 			i) A obj1=new A();==> Fixed Object
 * 
 * 			ii) A obj2=new A("Veli Han",13);
 * 				A obj3=new A("Ayse Tan",23);
 * 
 * 			iii) A obj4=new A();
 * 				   obj4.setName("Ayse Tan");
 * 				   obj4.setAge(43);
 * 					.
 * 				   obj4.setName("mark Stone");
 * 				   obj4.setAge(23);
 * 					.
 * 			
 * 2) Polymorphism(Multiple forms); Overloading+Overriding
 * 		a) Overliading...
 * 
 * 
 * 		b) Overriding....
 * 
 
 
 		c)What is the difference between "overloading and overriding?
 		
 			i) Overloading does not need "inheritance", but inheritance is must for "overriding"
 			ii) private and static methods can be overloaded but private and static methods cannot be overridden.
 			iii) final methods can be overloaded. Final methods cannot be overridden.
 			iV) Overloading happens in Compile time, but overriding happens in Run time.
 			V) Overloading is faster than overriding.
 			
 			
 		  				
 * 
 * 3) Inheritance...
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Abstraction:
 *
